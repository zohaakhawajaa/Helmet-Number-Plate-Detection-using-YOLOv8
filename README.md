# Helmet-Number-Plate-Detection-using-YOLOv8
Semester project on helmet and number plate detection using YOLOv8. Built a real-life dataset from scratch with two classes for object detection. The repo includes images, YOLO annotations, trained model &amp;demo videos, demonstrating accurate detection in practical scenarios. A complete pipeline from data collection → annotation → training → testing.
