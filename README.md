# Helmet & Number Plate Detection using YOLOv8

This repository contains my **semester project** on **real-world object detection** for **helmets and number plates** using **YOLOv8**. The dataset was **created from scratch** with real-life images, and the model demonstrates **accurate two-object detection**.
